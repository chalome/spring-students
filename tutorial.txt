Great progress! To enhance your knowledge of Spring Boot APIs, here are some topics you can explore:

Advanced Spring Boot Topics:
Validation and Exception Handling:

Add request validation using @Valid and @NotNull, etc.
Customize exception handling with @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.
Pagination and Sorting:

Implement pagination and sorting in your API responses using Spring Data JPA's Pageable.
Spring Security:

Secure your APIs with JWT or OAuth2.
Implement role-based access control.
Global Error Handling:

Create a consistent error response structure using @RestControllerAdvice.
DTOs and Mapping:

Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for better separation of concerns.
Use libraries like MapStruct or ModelMapper for mapping entities to DTOs.
Testing APIs:

Write unit tests with JUnit and Mockito.
Write integration tests with @SpringBootTest and MockMvc.
Logging and Monitoring:

Use SLF4J and Logback for logging.
Integrate tools like Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring.
File Upload and Download:

Implement APIs for uploading and downloading files.
Asynchronous Programming:

Use @Async for running background tasks.
Explore reactive programming with Project Reactor and WebFlux.
Caching:

Implement caching with Spring Cache or Redis to improve performance.
Versioning APIs:

Use URL-based or header-based versioning strategies.
HATEOAS:

Add Hypermedia links to your APIs using Spring HATEOAS for RESTful best practices.
Internationalization (i18n):

Add support for multiple languages in API responses.
Event-Driven Architecture:

Use Spring Events or message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka to build event-driven systems.
Documentation:

Document your APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI and SpringDoc.
Deploying and Scaling:

Learn Docker and Kubernetes to containerize and deploy your Spring Boot application.
Explore how to scale using cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
